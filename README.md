I am striving to become the best developer I can be!
I have always been interested in technology and have been coding for the past 18 months. During this time, I completed many online courses and tutorials, and applied what I learnt by creating a number of projects. I quickly realised that I have a real passion for Software Development, more so than anything I have ever done in my career, so I left my "safe" career as a Mechanical Project Manager to pursue my dream job. I completed the Software Development Bootcamp at Makers Academy, where I strengthened my ability to self-teach coding languages and technologies, and used the Agile methodology and Test Driven Development to create high quality code. 
Since completing the course, I have spent my time creating applications and honing my skills. I would love to network with likeminded people and you can find my social media links below.

### Skills


Whilst working as a Mechanical Project Manager, I honed skills in ***teamwork*** and ***communication***, with my direct team, sub-contractors, suppliers and clients. To ensure that projects were delivered to the clients' specifications whilst safeguarding profit for the business, I utilised skills in ***relationship building***, ***critical thinking*** and strong written skills in ***report writing***. 
I am ***self-motivated*** and ***driven***. I am skilled in ***Agile Methodologies*** and ***Test Driven Development*** and utilise these to create high quality code. 
I have learnt a number of languages and technologies in my career to date, including React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Next.js, Bootstrap, Vercel, Circle CI, Ruby, ruby on Rails, Travis CI, Sinatra, Capybara, RSpec, Postgresql. I love to learn and am confident to self-teach any languages and technologies that I am not currently conversant in.

## My Journey 
I have been working in construction for all of my adult life, apart from the 8 months I spent working at a Blockbusters video store. After my short stent in the "plastic disk for hire business" I landed an apprenticeship at a company that installs heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) which is just a fancy way of saying "air con". Fast forward 10 years and I had filled my boots with all the air con issues and refrigerant burns with the same company. It was time for change, so I left the land of lions, Table Mountain and great weather for the U.K - where better to go than a place that has "Great" in its title. In the UK, I continued my career as a Mechanical Project Manager on various construction projects. 

18 months ago I stumbled across the massive coding world and could not keep my fingers off my keyboard, which led me to enrol in the full-time Software Development course at Makers Academy. I loved my time at Makers and impressed myself with the amount that I was able to self-teach in the 12 weeks I was there and the strides that I made in my knowledge.

I have faced great challenges in my life and these challenges have only made me a more competent, conscious, caring and eager person, and I cannot wait for my next great challenge.
