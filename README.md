I am striving to become the best developer I can possibly be. I am currently on a developer boot camp provided by <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a>. I have been interested in coding for the past 18 months and have made real efforts to absorb as much as possible with short courses, tutorials and self study. During this period I have realized that only by commiting to coding full time, will I be able to make the progress I require to be able to work in the coding world as I intend to. I have left my "safe" career as a mechanical project manager to persue my dream job. I would like to improve my network to the developers "world". Please see my social media links below, I look forward to hearing from you.

### Skills


Whilst working as a mechanical project manager I have learned the importance of ***teamwork*** and ***communication***, whether it be within my direct team, sub-contractors, supplier or the client. There are a few munitions I have in my arsenal to ensure all aspects got delivered to the clients' specifications and to ensure the project was profitable. ***Report writing*** on a weekly/monthly basis such as ***financial***, ***progress*** and ***technical reports*** were of paramount importance. The reason the projects I managed were successful was due to my ***self-motivation*** and ***client-facing*** approach, as I was the point of contact between the end-user and the people physically executing the project. ***Technical ability*** is just as important, as the design did at times fall short due to inconclusive surveys, overlooked details or historical information not being available. I was able to overcome these issues with minimal to no financial lost and within the target date, regardless of time constraints. This has only improved my ***critical thinking*** and on-the-spot ***decision making*** for the next potential issue.

## My Journey 

I have been working in construction for all my adult life apart form 8 months spent working at Blockbusters, ah yes the “good old days” where you had to leave your house to rent a movie and pay a fee if you returned it late. I have amassed a vast amount of skills and knowledge over my career, especially the past 5 years as I have been in a management position for projects and departments respectively. Working as a mechanical project manager I have had to deal with rushed deadlines, tight budget constraints, client specifications and more than my fair share of clashing personalities. I have worked in teams to deliver projects worth millions of pounds and I have worked on projects single handidly. I have faced great challenges in both my professional and personal life, these challenges have only left me a more competent, consciences, caring and eager human being and I cannot wait for my next great challenge.
