I am striving to become the best backend/frontend developer I can possibly be. I am currently on  developer boot camp provided by <a Makers="https://makers.tech/become/apprentice/?utm_term=&utm_campaign=B2C+%7C+Apprenticeships&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=7172166340&hsa_cam=11854231084&hsa_grp=115529764057&hsa_ad=497903973780&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=dsa-1228217883487&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9_mDBhCGARIsAN3PaFNHZFPHgsAAIKLh02JkhII4Z4JfgmLk_akWtH8OtRFTvqbIN7efOnQaAgT7EALw_wcB>Makers</a> 

## My Journey 
I have been working in construction for all my adult life apart form 8 months spent working at Blockbusters, ah yes the “good old days” where you had to leave your house to rent a movie and pay a fee if you returned it late. I have amassed a vast amount of skills and knowledge over my career, especially the past 5 years as I have been in a management position for projects and departments respectively. Working as a mechanical project manager I have had to deal with rushed deadlines, tight budget constraints, client specifications and more than my fair share of clashing personalities. I have worked in teams to deliver projects worth millions of pounds and I have worked on projects on my own worth six figures. I have faced great challenges in both my professional and personal life, these challenges have only left me a more competent, consciences, caring and eager human being and I cannot wait to my next great challenge.  

### SOFT SKILLS I HAVE ACQUIRED
+ Teamwork
+ Communication
+ Financial reporting
+ Progress reporting
+ Working to deadlines
+ Client facing (reporting progress/explaining facets that they do not understand completely)
+ Self-motivation 
+ Training
