# Dewald Viljoen (Dev)

I am striving to become the best developer I can possibly be. I am currently on a developer boot camp provided by <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>. I have been interested in coding for the past year and a half and have made real efforts to absorb as much as possible for the last year with short courses, tutorials and self study. During this period I have realized that only by commiting to coding full time will I be able to make the progress I require to be able to work in the coding world as I intend to. I have left my "safe" career as a mechanical project manager to persue my dream job.

### SOFT SKILLS I HAVE ACQUIRED
Whilst working as a mechanical project manager I have learned the importance of **teamwork** and **communication**, whether it be within my direct team, sub-contractors, supplier or the client. There are a few tools I had in my arsenal to ensure all aspects got delivered to the clients specifications and to ensure the project was profitable,  **report writing** on a weekly/monthly basis such as **financial reporting**, **progress reporting** and **technical reports** where of paramount importance. For a project to be successful it was imperical that I am **self-motivated** and **client facing** as I was the point of contact between the end user and the people physically executing the project. **Technical ability** is just as important as the design did at times fall short due to inconclusive surveys, overlooked details or historic information not being available, I have been given the oppertunity to overcome these issues as they arrise with the least financial or time consuming impacts. This has only assisted with my **critical thinking** and on the spot decision making for the next potential issue.

## My Journey 
I have been working in construction for all my adult life apart form 8 months spent working at Blockbusters, ah yes the “good old days” where you had to leave your house to rent a movie and pay a fee if you returned it late. I have amassed a vast amount of skills and knowledge over my career, especially the past 5 years as I have been in a management position for projects and departments respectively. Working as a mechanical project manager I have had to deal with rushed deadlines, tight budget constraints, client specifications and more than my fair share of clashing personalities. I have worked in teams to deliver projects worth millions of pounds and I have worked on projects single handidly. I have faced great challenges in both my professional and personal life, these challenges have only left me a more competent, consciences, caring and eager human being and I cannot wait for my next great challenge.
