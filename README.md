# Dewald Viljoen (Dev)

I am striving to become the best developer I can possibly be. I am currently on a developer boot camp provided by <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>. I have been interested in coding for the past year and a half and have made real efforts to absorb as much as possible for the last year with short courses, tutorials and self study. During this period I have realized that only by commiting to coding full time will I be able to make the progress I require to be able to work in the coding world as I intend to, so this is exactly what I did.

## My Journey 
I have been working in construction for all my adult life apart form 8 months spent working at Blockbusters, ah yes the “good old days” where you had to leave your house to rent a movie and pay a fee if you returned it late. I have amassed a vast amount of skills and knowledge over my career, especially the past 5 years as I have been in a management position for projects and departments respectively. Working as a mechanical project manager I have had to deal with rushed deadlines, tight budget constraints, client specifications and more than my fair share of clashing personalities. I have worked in teams to deliver projects worth millions of pounds and I have worked on projects on my own worth six figures. I have faced great challenges in both my professional and personal life, these challenges have only left me a more competent, consciences, caring and eager human being and I cannot wait for my next great challenge.  

### SOFT SKILLS I HAVE ACQUIRED
+ Teamwork
+ Communication
+ Financial reporting
+ Progress reporting
+ Working to deadlines
+ Client facing (reporting progress/explaining facets that they do not understand completely)
+ Self-motivation 
+ Training
