# Dewald Viljoen (Dev)
---
I am striving to become the best backend/frontend developer I can possibly be. I am currently on  developer boot camp provided by <a Makers="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a> 

## My Journey 
I have been working in construction for all my adult life apart form 8 months spent working at Blockbusters, ah yes the “good old days” where you had to leave your house to rent a movie and pay a fee if you returned it late. I have amassed a vast amount of skills and knowledge over my career, especially the past 5 years as I have been in a management position for projects and departments respectively. Working as a mechanical project manager I have had to deal with rushed deadlines, tight budget constraints, client specifications and more than my fair share of clashing personalities. I have worked in teams to deliver projects worth millions of pounds and I have worked on projects on my own worth six figures. I have faced great challenges in both my professional and personal life, these challenges have only left me a more competent, consciences, caring and eager human being and I cannot wait to my next great challenge.  

### SOFT SKILLS I HAVE ACQUIRED
+ Teamwork
+ Communication
+ Financial reporting
+ Progress reporting
+ Working to deadlines
+ Client facing (reporting progress/explaining facets that they do not understand completely)
+ Self-motivation 
+ Training
