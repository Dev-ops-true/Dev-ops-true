I am striving to become the best developer I can possibly be. I am currently on a developer boot camp provided by <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a>. I have been interested in coding for the past 18 months and have made real efforts to absorb as much as possible with short courses, tutorials and self study. During this period I have realized that only by commiting to coding full time, will I be able to make the progress I require to be able to work in the coding world as I intend to. I have left my "safe" career as a mechanical project manager to persue my dream job. I would like to improve my network to the developers "world". Please see my social media links below, I look forward to hearing from you.

### Skills


Whilst working as a mechanical project manager I have learned the importance of ***teamwork*** and ***communication***, whether it be within my direct team, sub-contractors, supplier or the client. There are a few munitions I have in my arsenal to ensure all aspects got delivered to the clients' specifications and to ensure the project was profitable. ***Report writing*** on a weekly/monthly basis such as ***financial***, ***progress*** and ***technical reports*** were of paramount importance. The reason the projects I managed were successful was due to my ***self-motivation*** and ***client-facing*** approach, as I was the point of contact between the end-user and the people physically executing the project. ***Technical ability*** is just as important, as the design did at times fall short due to inconclusive surveys, overlooked details or historical information not being available. I was able to overcome these issues with minimal to no financial lost and within the target date, regardless of time constraints. This has only improved my ***critical thinking*** and on-the-spot ***decision making*** for the next potential issue.

## My Journey 

I have been working in construction for all my adult life, apart from the 8 months I spent working at a Blockbusters video store. Ah yes the “good old days” where you had to leave your house to rent a movie and pay a fee if you returned it late. After my short stent in the "plastic disk for hire bussiness" I landed an apprentiship at a company that installs heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) which is just a fancy way of saying "aircons". Skip forward 10 years and I had filled my boots with all the aircon issues, refrigerant burns and overtime for the same company. It was time for change, so I up and left the land of lions, Table mountain and great weather for Europe, and where better to go than a place that has "Great" in its title. I then continued my career as a mechanical project manager on various construction projects. 

18 months ago I stumbled across this massive coding world and could not keep my fingers off my keyboard, which eventually lead me to enrolling into a full-time developer course.

I have faced great challenges in my life and these challenges have only made me a more competent, consciences, caring and eager person, and I cannot wait for my next great challenge.
